        I'm a <Highlight>passionate software developer</Highlight> with an engineering
        background who thrives in web development. While <Highlight
          >comfortable across the full stack</Highlight

        Outside of work, I contribute to <Highlight
          >open-source projects</Highlight

          >expand my technical expertise</Highlight
        >, try to keep up with the latest web development trends, and
        <Highlight

        When unplugged from code, you'll find me cruising on my longboard,
        immersed in video games, or enjoying films. My free time is also happily
        spent with my six pets - three dogs and three cats. üê∂üê±
